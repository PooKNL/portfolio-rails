/ Portfolio site RJ v 0.5 /

This is my first attempt at a portfolio site I want to use for my future projects and blog. I made a lot of use of tutorials which I shall mention below at the readme. The site is at about 70% and the next focus would be filling the site and actually start styling as it is still very bland. My aim is to get to a usuable version 2 weeks from now.

1/ Getting Started /

When all the features are done I will provide instructions of the prerequisites, how to run the tests and which steps that need to be taken to get it all running.

2 / Acknowledgments / 

The way the site is largely based on Mackenzie Child≈õ tutorial on youtube.

Kind regards, Robert Jan
